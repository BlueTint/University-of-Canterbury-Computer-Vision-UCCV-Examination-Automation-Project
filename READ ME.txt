this folder is provding all the material of the final version coding for the project

there will be 2 versions of script under notebook format:
	- comprehensive version will be the final version, which was done as functions, and designed 
		to loop thru all the files in given folder and end up with the excel output table.
	- comprehansive version is used for debugging, which will be broken into step by step with output of each step.

the setting of the some coding in these 2 versions may be lightly different due to changing to improve the performance

the code is designed to run in colab will need to be changed to run in another enviroment, such as cv2_imshow() in colde need to replace by cv2.imshow or plot if not run in colab

all the inputs,dataframe and model were saved and loaded directly from google drive, as well as outputing.
therefor this directory need to be changed if the data is stored and loaded from local drive.

the 1st 2 lines of the 1st cell need to be run everytime start the colab as the colab does not include this library.

the in use folder will contain only the models that already pluged-in with the main code. another trained models were saved under folder 2

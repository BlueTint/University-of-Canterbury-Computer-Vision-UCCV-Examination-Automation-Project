UCCV School of Mathematics &amp; Engineering 2020-2021 Project - Using Computer Vision and Deep Learning to automate examinations processing

Abstract
Educational Institutions have a core reliance on the practice of
examinations for student performance assessment. As
technological advancements continue to be a pervasive force in
the improvement of education at a wide scope, the process of
data ingestion of handwritten examinations continues to remain
a process of manual human data interpretation and entry.
The application of deep learning and computer vision tools and
methodologies can be employed to automate this process to
reach an accuracy that can mimic human-level error. 

This project serves a long-standing need for the University of Canterbury School of Engineering. The
UC school of engineering offers a diverse range of academic courses throughout each academic year,
with students partaking in multiple papers every term, semester and academic year. The UC engineering
school itself, as part of the greater UC institution, accounts for a large portion of the UC academic
institution itself in terms of the student body population. The project originates from the biannual (in
some cases, more frequent) course examinations that are undertaken which traditionally sees a heavily
paper-based, in-person, supervised method. While much of the examinations processing methodology
which aims to get the completed exams from the exam script to a finalised grade that is available to
students online has remained the same and may remain the same for some time to come; a particular
step within the examinations processing pipeline has been identified as having the potential to be
markedly improved upon in terms of automation efficiency.
